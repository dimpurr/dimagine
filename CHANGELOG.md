## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Index scans reject writes outside an active transaction, validate required
  schema keys and FTS synchronization triggers, and use Unicode case folding
  for text search.
- Prototype scripts: an Eagle importer and a tool that adds missing
  self-embeds (`scripts/prototype/`).
- Format 0.1 draft revision: image notes end with an embed of their own image;
  file names avoid `[ ] # ^ |`.
- Library format 0.1 draft (`docs/FORMAT.md`) and the agent skill (`SKILL.md`).
- Project restart: README, MIT license, contributor and agent rules, vision and
  documentation index.

### Removed
- The 2019 prototype (an Express/Pug Pinterest for illustrators). Its code is
  kept at tag `v0-2019`.
